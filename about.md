My technical background is in creating and operating large-scale web applications with millions of users. I have extensive experience building and managing high-performance teams, and consider myself a fan of agile development practices and the lean startup movement. I founded and ran a startup with 30 people for 4 years. In the last 10 years my roles have been Director of Engineering/CTO for Sport1, Pokermania and SinnerSchrader/part of Accenture Interactive.
