My technical background is in creating and operating large-scale web applications. I have extensive experience building and managing high-performance teams, and consider myself a fan of agile development practices and the lean startup movement. I have held roles as developer, consultant and development leader. In the last eight years I have been a Director of Engineering/CTO for Sport1 and Pokermania.
